# Social Network


## About

Social networking apps are commonly used nowadays. Like others, they allow users to like, post, comment, and view other users posts.



## Features


Users have to be registered and logged in to use the application. They may
create an account on this website, or log in using their Google or any other
accounts.

Once logged in, users can post comments that contain the date and time of posting, 
or they can modify and update their personal profiles.

## Things to-do
- Revise the CSS to enhance the centering of inputs and buttons.
- After each action such as logging in, registering, or posting,
  include formal text instead of Lorem Ipsum.
- Relax the password requirements as they are too restrictive 
  due to the excessive number of characters required.
- Establish hosting infrastructure for the application as a base.
- Add proper name for project.

> **NOTE:** this is only a rough plan. Ideas may be removed/added/modified in
> the future.
